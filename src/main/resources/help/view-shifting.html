            <p>The world can be moved by means of <kbd>WSAD</kbd> keys or arrows. By default, it is the camera that is moved over the world (<kbd>W</kbd> = the User flies northwards). To move the world (<kbd>W</kbd> = the world is moved northwards), use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>.</p>
            <p>By default, at the beginning of a human player's move, the world is moved so that the center of the world be in the center of the world panel. To disable this, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.</p>
