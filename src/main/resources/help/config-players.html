            <h1>Players Configuration</h1>

            <p>In "The Global Empire", there can be up to eight players. They can be human players and bots. There must be at least one human player. There must be at least two players in total.</p>
            <p>Later, the User can come back to this view.</p>

            <h2>Number of Players</h2>
            <p>In the players configuration view, the User can choose how many human players and bots there will be. On selecting the number of players of one kind by clicking appropriate circle button, the last buttons in the other kind will be disabled, because it is impossible to declare more players than the limit is.</p>

            <h2>Parameters of Players</h2>
            <p>For every declared player, their color can be chosen. Option "Random" can also be selected. Every color is unique: once a player is assigned certain color, no one else can have that color (it is dropped from other lists).</p>
            <p>Human players can introduce their names. They do not have to be unique (but it is advised). Inputting an empty name results in the player being named "Anonymous the Conqueror".</p>
